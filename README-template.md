## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React.js

### What I learned


I learned how to create a component.
```jsx
const QRCard = () => {

  return (
    <>
      <img className="qr-img" src="/imgs/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
      <div className="text-container">
        <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take you coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```
 And how to import it.
```jsx
import './App.css'
import QRCard from './components/QRCard'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
        <div className='container'>
          <QRCard />
        </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Continued development


React.js is a very powerful tool. I look forward to learning more about props, states, hooks, and how to implement ES6 to make the most out of it.
